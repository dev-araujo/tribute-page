            2 July 1877 – 9 August 1962) was a German-Swiss poet, novelist, and
            painter. His best-known works include Demian, Steppenwolf,
            Siddhartha, and The Glass Bead Game, each of which explores an
            individual's search for authenticity, self-knowledge and
            spirituality. In 1946, he received the Nobel Prize in Literature.

            On 17 October 1895, Hesse began working in the bookshop in Tübingen,
            which had a specialized collection in theology, philology, and
            law. Hesse's tasks consisted of organizing, packing, and
            archiving the books. After the end of each twelve-hour workday,
            Hesse pursued his own work, and he spent his long, idle Sundays with
            books rather than friends. Hesse studied theological writings and
            later Goethe, Lessing, Schiller, and Greek mythology. He also began
            reading Nietzsche in 1895, and that philosopher's ideas of
            "dual…impulses of passion and order" in humankind was a heavy
            influence on most of his novels.

            By 1898, Hesse had a respectable income that enabled financial
            independence from his parents. During this time, he concentrated
            on the works of the German Romantics, including much of the work of
            Clemens Brentano, Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff, Friedrich
            Hölderlin, and Novalis. In letters to his parents, he expressed a
            belief that "the morality of artists is replaced by aesthetics".
          </p>

            During this time, he was introduced to the home of Fräulein von
            Reutern, a friend of his family's. There he met with people his own
            age. His relationships with his contemporaries were "problematic",
            in that most of them were now at university. This usually left him
            feeling awkward in social situations.

            In 1896, his poem "Madonna" appeared in a Viennese periodical and
            Hesse released his first small volume of poetry, Romantic Songs. In
            1897, a published poem of his, "Grand Valse", drew him a fan letter.
            It was from Helene Voigt, who the next year married Eugen
            Diederichs, a young publisher. To please his wife, Diederichs agreed
            to publish Hesse's collection of prose entitled One Hour After
            Midnight in 1898 (although it is dated 1899). Both works were a
            business failure. In two years, only 54 of the 600 printed copies of
            Romantic Songs were sold, and One Hour After Midnight received only
            one printing and sold sluggishly. Furthermore, Hesse "suffered a
            great shock" when his mother disapproved of "Romantic Songs" on the
            grounds that they were too secular and even "vaguely sinful".
